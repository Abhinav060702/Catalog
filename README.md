# this code is taking the number of roots (n) and minimum number of roots(k) such that it calculates the value of constant C 
# using the Lagrange interpolation method and also the use of nlohmann/json.hpp such that the given input in json format is first parsed 
# to decode the value y and then from the obtained points , calculate c
