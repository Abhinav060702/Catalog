# this code is taking the number of roots (n) and minimum number of roots(k).
# input the roots in json format and you should have  <nlohmann/json.hpp> header file present
#  such that it calculates the value of constant C 
# using the Lagrange interpolation method and  the use of nlohmann/json.hpp such that the given input in json format is first parsed 
# to decode the value y and then from the obtained points , calculate c
